# Slimecaster

**Slimecaster** is a **fast-paced action game** developed in **GameMaker Studio 2**, where you play as a powerful slime mage fighting for survival against a rival species of **scarlet slimes**. 

## 📝 Project Description  

In **Slimecaster**, you control a magical **slime mage**, battling against relentless waves of **scarlet slimes**. Your ultimate goal is to **defeat Gravul**, the **King of the Scarlet Slimes**, before his forces overwhelm you. The game delivers **fast-paced combat, spellcasting mechanics, and intense survival gameplay** to keep players engaged.  

## 🕹️ How to Play  

1. **Aim** at enemy slimes using your mouse.  
2. **Left-click** for single shots.  
3. **Right-click** to unleash a **ten-shot burst**.  
4. **Press `X`** to reload your burst cannon.  
5. **Use the mouse wheel** for **quick bursts of fire**. 

## 📥 Installation  

Download  **Slimecaster** from the [latest release](https://github.com/kireiiiiiiii/Slimecaster/releases/latest). You can only download an `.exe`, because of GameMaker not supporting exporting for MacOS without a developer license costing about a $100 per year. (Sorry Mac users...). You can still play this game though by running it from source.

### 🖥️ Running from Source  

To run the game from the **source code**, follow these steps:  

- **Clone or download** the repository
- **Open the project** in **GameMaker Studio 2**
- You have to use this or higher version of GameMaker, for the project to work: 
   - IDE: v2024.8.1.171
   - Runtime: v2024.8.1.218
- **Build and run** the game
